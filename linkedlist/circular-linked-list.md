![circular linked list](./images/circular-linked-list.png)

### Node contains

1. Data
1. Pointer reference to next node
1. At some node pointer reference will be pointing to data of previous node by making it a circular linked list.

### Points to remember

- First node is called head (head is always starts with null).
- From head, each node has a value and a pointer reference to next node.
- At some node pointer reference will be pointing to data of previous node by making it a circular linked list.
- There is no last node in circular linked list
